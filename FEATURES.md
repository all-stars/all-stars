## Capabilities

### Organization
An organization is the highest level group in All Stars. An organization can be managed by one or more global
administrators. Global admins can perform system level functions and manage other lower level entities like [Teams](#team).

### Team
An organization can create groups within itself called Teams. Each team has one or more team leads. The number of team
leads should be limited to usually one or two - the lesser the better. Apart from team leads, a team will have 
[Team Member](#team-member) or just members. [Team leads](#team-lead) can manage all aspects of the team. A global admin
can also perform all functions that a team lead can perform. Similarly, a team lead can perform all functions that a 
team member can perform. 

### Team Lead
A team lead performs various tasks like:
1. Manage all system level functions for the team like maintenance and reporting activities.
2. Approve requests from internal team members or other persons like request to join a team.
3. Create tasks and publish them as up for grabs.
4. Create tags that could be attached to tasks.
5. Assign points to tasks. Edit points for tasks.
6. Create reports for the entire team.

### Team Member
Team Members shine by putting up their A game and compete against others and themselves. They grab work as an when they
are available. They are the most important players in the All Stars platform and are the reason for even All Stars to
exist. They do the following:

1. Grab tasks whenever they are available.
2. Work on those tasks and send for review.
3. Can create tasks and send them for approval.
4. Help other team members and earn valuable points.

### Leaderboards 
All Stars shows up Team leaderboards and organization wide leaderboards. Everybody can have a view on where they stand
in the team and the organization. Everyone can see their reputation and badges. High reputation allows you to do some
amazing things and paves the way for becoming team leads.
The overall reputation is based on points accumulated and any badges won. Leaderboards show monthly, quarterly and annual
numbers and trends.

### Task
Tasks are logical pieces of work which lead to some tangible or non-tangible outputs. Tasks can belong to various
categories like project-work, hackathons, social, administrative and others. Categories can be managed by team leads
and they may be specific to a team. Global categories also exist that can be configured by a global admin. Team
members gather points by doing tasks. They earn badges by crossing milestones and they have a chance to be at the top
of the table. Tasks may be created by team leads and also by team members. If team members create tasks, they go through
a review process. Tasks can only be allocated by a single team member. A team member can choose to onboard one or
more team members and share points with them. The ownership of the task rests solely with the team member who claimed 
the task originally.

Tasks go through a bidding process. Any number of team members can bid for a task. The task will be awarded to the team
member who can complete the task with the lowest total cost. One can do a maximum of two parallel tasks in which case the
effort per day is split equally between the tasks. Each workday has a fixed number of work hours which can be set by the
team lead and global administrators.

Tasks have priority, planned start date, planned end date, actual start date, actual end date, status etc. A task can
either go through the bidding process or through a direct assignment. 

When a team member completes the task, they submit the task for review. While a task is being reviewed, the clock pauses
for the task and does not accrue cost. When a team member claims a task, they must provide an estimated cost and a 
promised end date - that's the planned end date. Missing the planned end date will accrues negative points. One can
request the task to be put on hold. Successful completion of tasks will collect the advertised points for the task. 
Cost overruns will attract penalty.

### Tag
Team members and team leads can tag tasks with keywords, keywords can be created by team leads. Team members can also 
create tags and attach to tasks, but they won't be visible globally unless they are approved by a team lead. Team 
members with high reputation may create tags without approval.
